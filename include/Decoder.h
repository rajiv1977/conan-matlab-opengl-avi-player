/// <summary>
/// H264::Decoder
/// ---------------------------------------
///
/// Example that shows how to use the libav parser system. This class forces a
/// H264 parser and codec. You use it by opening a file that is encoded with x264
/// using the "load()" function. You can pass the framerate you want to use for playback.
/// If you don't pass the framerate, we will detect it as soon as the parser found
/// the correct information.
///
/// After calling "load()", you can call "readFrame()" which will read a new frame when
/// necessary. It will also make sure that it will read enough data from the buffer/file
/// when there is not enough data in the buffer.
///
/// "readFrame()" will trigger calls to the given "h264_decoder_callback" that you pass
/// to the constructor.
